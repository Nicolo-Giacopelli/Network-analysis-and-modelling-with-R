# Network-analysis-and-modelling-with-R
In this project we implemented in a group of three a marketing study for a big french charity. Data was provided by the professor, reliable and coming from the actual business environment over a span of ten years. We performed segmentation based on network analysis, by constructing relationships between donours if they were donating in the same periods. This idea was then used to produce a long-terms solicitation schedules, by targeting different groups with different frequencies, together with CLV estimation. </br> </br> The repo comprises the code used for network analysis and segmentation, together with the final presentation. The second R file contains the models implemented in order to evaluate the accuracy of regularized models for short-term targeting of donours to be sollicited. In the latter case, the data has been initially masked and the financial performance has been evaluated, in a sort of competition between individuals. </br> The model achieved the $5^{\text{th}}$ position as the best-performing one out of $120$.
